## Notes

### Project Challenges and Learnings

During this React project, I encountered several significant challenges. **State management** across components required careful synchronization to ensure smooth performance. I utilized the `useCallback` hook to optimize API call functions, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving efficiency. Learning **TypeScript** for the first time was a crucial experience, enhancing my understanding of type safety and code reliability through accurate type definitions.

Additionally, I tackled **styling issues** and integrated the Embla Carousel library. This involved resolving CSS conflicts and ensuring the carouselâ€™s functionality aligned with dynamic card components. Merging the card creation feature with the carousel presented its own set of challenges, requiring seamless integration for a cohesive user experience. These tasks highlighted my ability to manage complex state, optimize performance, and effectively handle interactive components and styling in a React application.
